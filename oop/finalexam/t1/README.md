## Program Description

This Java program manipulates two predefined lists:

- `list1`: A list of integers  
- `list2`: A list of strings  

It constructs a third list, `list3`, by following these steps:

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Build `list3`

For each element `n` in `list1`:
1. Calculate `index = n + 1`
2. Access `list2` at this index
3. Append the result of `list2[index] + n` into `list3`

Example:
```java
list1 = [7]
list2 = [..., "hez", "xky", ...] // assume xky is at index 8

â†’ list2[7 + 1] = list2[8] = "xky"
â†’ result = "xky7"
â†’ list3 = ["xky7"]

Error Handling: 

If an index n + 1 from list1 goes beyond the size of list2, the program:
Does not crash
Skips that entry and continues with the rest of the list
